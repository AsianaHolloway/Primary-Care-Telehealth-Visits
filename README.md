  Increased engagement, better chronic care management, improved work-life balance for physicians, and broader reach.

- **Limitations**  
  Barriers such as data privacy concerns, state licensure issues, limited EHR integration, and the digital divide.

- **AI & Innovation in Telehealth**  
  Discussed emerging technologies including virtual health assistants, predictive analytics, remote monitoring, and computer vision.

- **Telehealth ROI**  
  Financial and operational returns from telehealth in primary care, including a case study on telecardiology.

## ü§ù Collaboration & Methodology

This project was a collaborative group effort. Each member contributed to literature review, design, presentation flow, and data gathering. Here‚Äôs how we approached our research:

- **Literature Review:**  
  Analyzed peer-reviewed articles, whitepapers, and industry reports including data from the CDC, American Telemedicine Association, and Commonwealth Fund.

- **Surveys & Interviews:**  
  We conducted a **questionnaire for physicians**, with 10 total responses (6 from Michigan-based providers). The insights supported our claims about adoption, satisfaction, and usability of telehealth in primary care.

- **Case Studies:**  
  Incorporated real-world case examples to assess telehealth's financial and operational ROI.

- **Presentation Creation:**  
  Designed collaboratively with all team members, ensuring clarity in data storytelling and visual engagement.
